# Shoppers-Intention-Detection
This project focuses on predicting customer purchase intention for travel insurance using machine learning techniques. Travel insurance provides financial protection against unexpected events while traveling abroad, and predicting customer interest in purchasing this type of insurance can be crucial for travel agents and online insurers. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and statistical analysis, we identify relevant variables and trends. We then build and fine-tune machine learning models to achieve accurate predictions.

### Data Source

## Key Features
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing 13k rows and 18 columns to gain insights into the data and identify patterns related to travel insurance purchase intent.
* Performed data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure data integrity, setting a solid foundation for subsequent analysis and modeling.
* Utilized statistical analysis techniques, including chi-square tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and point biserial correlation, to establish meaningful correlations between variables and their impact on purchase intention.
* Programmed various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Soft Margin SVM, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks, to assess their efficacy in predicting travel insurance purchase intent.
* Employed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the machine learning models, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 78% for customer purchase detection.
* Addressed the issue of imbalanced datasets (only 20% in the positive class) by implementing the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) technique, leading to a substantial 15% enhancement in model performance.
